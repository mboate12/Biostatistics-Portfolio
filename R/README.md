# R Projects  

This folder contains R scripts and reports developed for **public health data analysis**. Projects include both **academic work** from my MPH in Biostatistics at GWU and **personal analyses** to strengthen technical skills.  

## Contents  
- **Academic Projects** – Coursework and research completed during the MPH program  
- **Personal Projects** – Independent data explorations and assessments  
- **RMarkdown Reports** – Reproducible analyses with narrative and visualizations  
- **Visualizations** – Graphs and plots created with `ggplot2`  
- **Data Wrangling** – Code using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and related packages  

These projects demonstrate skills in **data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization**, with applications in public health and beyond.
